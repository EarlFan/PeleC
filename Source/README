This is a README for GPU Changes and Hacks. 

A most notable change has been the translation of Fortran to C++ for all hydro routines 
(except the NSCBC). 

Only certain functionality was retained, and there is much todo: 
- PLM is implemented not PPM 
- There is no option for hybrid Riemann Solver 
- Riemann MD and Riemann US are implemented (Not HLLC) 
- Pslope is not implemented 
- PPM_TEMP_FIX is set to 0 
- ppm_trace_sources is set to 0 
- Density and rhoe are not reset in the transverse routines 
- Transverse routines do not use EOS 
- Flattening is not being used 
- Fluxes are not limited on small dens 
- Grid losses are not being tracked 
The Hydro Routines are located in PeleC_meth_$(DIM)D.H/cpp. 
Further umdrv functions are located in PeleC_K.H/cpp. 


An EOS object was constructed in PeleC to call Fuego Functions Directly. 
It is constructed assuming a LiDryer format. This will need to be generalized 
to use other ChemKin models as well as Real Gases. This Object is defined and 
implemented in PeleC_EOS.H and PeleC_EOS.cpp.
